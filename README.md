With aspirations to contribute as a space scientist, my pursuit is anchored in the belief that knowledge is the catalyst for unlocking the immense potential beyond our earthly boundaries.

### Available for

I'm available for collab on open-source projects and maybe some mechatronics too. I am also an ardent advocate for research collaboration. GitHub is not just a platform; it's the crucible where we developers ideas take shape, crystallizing into software that makes a difference. We can start working anytime, [C'mon](mailto:sagooon@outlook.com).

Previously, I've been working with autonomous flight computers using open-source hardware development and prototyping platforms. I'm also studying of Planetary Systems and Exoplanets using the data from <b>NASA missions: [TESS](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tess/) and [Kepler](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/kepler/)</b>.
