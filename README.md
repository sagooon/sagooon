### Introduction

In the vast canvas of the universe, I'm a tiny thread woven into the fabric of spacetime. I'm but a humble inter alia of mankind, expressing myself through these calculated words. <b>Saisagun Thapa (alias: sagooon), a Science Communicator and an aspiring Space Scientist</b>, well, that is how I get introduced. With an insatiable curiosity for innovation and a penchant for problem-solving, I research/code to architect complex solutions that transcend the ordinary.

### Available for

I'm available for collab on open-source projects and maybe some mechatronics too. I am also an ardent advocate for research collaboration. GitHub is not just a platform; it's the crucible where we developers ideas take shape, crystallizing into software that makes a difference. We can start working anytime, [C'mon](mailto:sagooon@outlook.com).

Previously, I've been working with autonomous flight computers using open-source hardware development and prototyping platforms. I'm also studying of Planetary Systems and Exoplanets using the data from <b>NASA missions: [TESS](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tess/) and [Kepler](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/kepler/)</b>.
